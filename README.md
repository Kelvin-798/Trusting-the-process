# Trusting-the-process
# I have lots of love for coding but never had the time to stay consistent and take it serious
# Maybe alot of people say coding is difficult so i never even try to fail
# Good news now is im ready to fail and push myself to love what i love 
# New me new me and i love this me
# Wishing myself lots of love and consistency 
# I need to be rich and believe you will make me rich
# Tough times dont last but tough people DO!!
# I am Kelvin and this is my journey.
